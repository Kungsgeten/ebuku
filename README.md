## Installation

Install [EBuku from MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/ebuku), or put the
`ebuku` folder in your load-path and do a `(load "ebuku")`.

## Usage

Create an EBuku buffer with <kbd>M-x ebuku</kbd>.

In the `*EBuku*` buffer, the following bindings are available:

* <kbd>s</kbd> - Search for a bookmark (`ebuku-search`).

* <kbd>r</kbd> - Show recently-added bookmarks (`ebuku-search-on-recent`).

* <kbd>g</kbd> - Refresh the search results, based on last search (`ebuku-refresh`).

* <kbd>RET</kbd> - Open the bookmark at point in a browser (`ebuku-open-url`).

* <kbd>a</kbd> - Add a new bookmark (`ebuku-add-bookmark`).

* <kbd>d</kbd> - Delete a bookmark (`ebuku-delete-bookmark`).  If point is on
  a bookmark, offer to delete that bookmark; otherwise, ask for the
  index of the bookmark to delete.

* <kbd>e</kbd> - Edit a bookmark (`ebuku-edit-bookmark`).  If point is on a
  bookmark, edit that bookmark; otherwise, ask for the index of the
  bookmark to edit.

* <kbd>q</kbd> - Quit EBuku.

## Customisation

The path to the `buku` executable, the number of bookmarks shown by
`ebuku-search-on-recent`, and the faces used by EBuku, can be
customised via the `ebuku` customize-group.

## TODO

* One should be able to edit bookmarks directly in the `*EBuku*`
  buffer, Ã  la `wdired`.  Much of the infrastructure to support this
  is already in place, but there are still important details yet to
  be implemented.
